# Detection Lab

## Objective

The Detection Lab project aims to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus is to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience will deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.




## Network Architecture

*Ref 1: Network Diagram*

This diagram represents the architecture of the detection lab, designed for monitoring and analyzing cyber threats.

- **SIEM Server (Splunk)** is at the top, acting as the central log collection and analysis system.
- **Attacker VM (Kali Linux)**  initiates attacks on the Victime System (Windows) and Web/App Server (Ubuntu) to simulate real-world threats.
- **IDS/IPS (Snort)** monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and sends alerts to the SIEM.
- **Arrows** indicate the direction of attack and log flow between components.



## Steps

#### 1. Install Oracle VirtualBox
- Download from official site.

#### 2. Deploy Virtual Machines  
- Download Kali Linux, Windows, and Ubuntu ISO files fromm the official site.
- Deploy Kali Linux, Windows, and Ubuntu on the Oracle VirtualBox.  

#### 3. Configure Logging & Monitoring  
- Send logs from all machines to SIEM.  

#### 4. Simulate Attacks  
- Use **Nmap, Metasploit**, and other tools.  

#### 5. Analyze Alerts in SIEM  
- Investigate security incidents.
